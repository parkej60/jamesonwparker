          <p>My adolescence was normal, summers were spent at the family cabin, nights spent on a dock gazing at the stars thinking there's is no way we're alone. From a young age I was enthralled with computers. Do you remember <a href="https://youtu.be/a1Ynw_iVAc8">Alfredo’s Firey Fiasco?</a> I sure do. My first foray into computers was an expo in Wausau, WI. Motherboards, RAM, CPUs and graphics cards, it was astonishing.</p>
          <p>Snowboarding in Colorado after I graduated sounded good for most of high school. However, my acceptance to the University-Wisconsin Oshkosh brought my dreams of a snowboarding career to an end. Graduating from college was definitely an accomplishment, figuring out what I was doing there took some time. But I made it through and ended up bumping into my future wife, although I didn’t know it at the time.</p>
          <p>After college I moved down to Chicago. I spent 4 years working really hard in Chicago, I meet some great friends and found one of my best ones, Jack my dog. And then out of the blue I stumbled into my future wife again. This time she didn't get away.</p>
          <p>Since then, I’ve moved to Milwaukee, my wife Kristin and I got married and we now own a house in Greendale, WI. The past few years we've been busy and they've gone really fast, but I think that is just how life is going to be for awhile. My family is wonderful and everyday isn't spectacular, but everyday is good.</p>
