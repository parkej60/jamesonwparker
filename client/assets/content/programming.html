          <p>While I was in college I was lucky enough to work for the university's IT department, where I eventually interned. As college was coming to an end I landed my first full-time job as a PC Technician at J.F. Ahern, where I was also able to help with some web development projects.</p>
          <p>In November 2008 I was given the opportunity to work as a Jr. Developer at Purohit Navigation, an advertising agency in Chicago. Since my time at Purohit I've worked for various other organizations and continue to pursue my passion for programming. I currently work as an iOS Developer for Centare Holdings, Inc. and have over 10+ years of professional technical experience.</p>
          <p>Over my career I've worn a lot of different hats, some of them at the same time. I've built a variety of applications from E-Learning games, large scale animations, websites and content managements in the web application arena. From a mobile stand point Iâ€™ve built inventory management solutions, custom BLE, travel insurance and brochureware iOS applications.</p>
           <p>Every role and opportunity I have been given has had it's own challenges and rewards. These experiences are the bricks which have paved the pathway to my current position as a Mobile Developer. For now my passion for mobile development takes up most of my time, but I still make time for tinkering as interests arise.</p>
